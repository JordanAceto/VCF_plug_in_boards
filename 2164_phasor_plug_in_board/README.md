## Details

Six stage phase shifter implemented with SSM2164/V2164/SSI2164 quad VCAs. This PCB includes the audio path and CV inputs for frequency and feedback, but does not include any modulation sources.

The intended use for this board is to plug in to a larger motherboard which contains slots for one or more of these plug-in boards, as well as modulation sources, panel controls, and input/output routing.


## Inputs

-Audio in: dry audio input to be phase shifted.

-Frequency CV in: 0 volts to +2.048 volts, higher voltage = higher sweep.

-Feedback CV in: 0 volts to +2.048 volts, higher voltage = more feedback.


## Outputs

-Audio out: phase shifted audio output.


## Power Supply Requirements

A bipolar 12 volt power supply is needed. This will typically come from the motherboard.


## Calibration

-RV1 (depth trim): trims the depth of incoming frequency CV signals. Turn CW for greater depth and CCW for less depth. Adjust to taste.

-RV2 (center trim): trims the center frequency of the phase shifter. Turn CW for higher center frequency and CCW for lower center frequency. Adjust to taste.

-RV3 (feedback trim): trims the maximum amount of feedback. Turn CW for more maximum feedback and CCW for less maximum feedback. Exercise caution when adjusting this, as extreme settings can result in loud oscillations which could damage your ears or speakers if you are monitoring the sound with a loud amplifier. If you set this trimmer to be right on the edge of oscillation when about +2 volts is applied to the feedback CV input then make sure to sweep the frequency through its entire range, as a setting that doesn't squeal at certain frequency settings may squeal at other settings.
